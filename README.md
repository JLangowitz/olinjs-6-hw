homework #6: Upgrading the FB app

## Assignment

We're going to update the Facebook app you guys created during the last homework. We're sick of being restricted to our own little world inside of MyFacebookSpace with all of our friends being on actual Facebook, so we're going to add functionality in order to interact with Facebook.

We want to be able to look at our friend's photos and add captions to them.

For the UI we want
* Pictures of us/our friends displayed through a nice scrolling JQuery photo plugin. Find one on Google.
* As we see each image, we should be able to add a caption to it.
* The caption should be pushed over to Facebook so that everyone else can see it.
* Push to Heroku.
* Update the homework sheet

This is the last of the homeworks. Once you finish congratulate yourself by smashing your laptop to bits. Or by watching the [best show ever](https://www.google.com/search?q=adventure+time+streaming&oq=adventure+time+streaming).
